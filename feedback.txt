A: checkout folder: TODO : mv components folder nested into shared components : DONE
  1: remove Layout.tsx because its now shared : DONE
  2: remove <FooterISPNavigation /> because Bianca has done it: Navigation
       <ProgressionFooter hideBottomButtons={boolean} /> : TODO: commit: Bianca : In progress

B: <Phase2ProgressionHeader /> to be fixed: Look at <ProgressionHeader /> 
    Will change to <ProgressionHeader /> by extending some props beacuse the only different between the 2 is checkout button 
      TODO : Commit: Bianca DONE

C: Extend StepInProgression enum to include phase-2: In progress
   
D: Put checkout pages into MwebContainer since the layout has changed: In progress
