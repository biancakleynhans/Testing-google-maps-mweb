                    We’re all about better Internet and technology, because we know how much of a difference it makes in our
                    lives, every day. That’s why we’ve been bringing better Internet to South Africa since 1997, connecting over
                    1,3 MILLION homes since we launched and are now the number 1 Fibre ISP in the country. From Fibre, LTE, (5G),
                    ADSL to a range of security products and so much more. We’re category leaders because we eat, sleep, and
                    breathe all there is to know about better Internet and always keep our customers at the heart of everything we
                    do. We know we’ll only reach our big betters with all the small betters along the way. Whether your better is
                    snuggling up to stream your favourite show or your better might be video calling your Gogo for hours, maybe
                    it’s even sharing a hundred funny reels with your bestie before 10am. Whatever your better. You deserve better
                    Internet in your pursuit of a better you, which is why we have dedicated teams, sites, and systems in place to
                    help you stay connected to better Internet 365 days a year.
